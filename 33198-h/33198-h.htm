<div class="blockquotn"><p><i>The history of the 18th-century Borghesi astronomical clock is
described here from contemporary source material. The evolution
of its design by Father Francesco Borghesi and the building of
the complex mechanism devised by the clockmaker, Bartolomeo
Antonio Bertolla, is a story of the vision of one man turned
into reality by another. The result of their collaboration is
the unique, astronomical timepiece now in the Museum of History
and Technology.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>"... All this work I had performed eagerly, so that, while in
my room, I might contemplate leisurely, both during the day and
in the night, the true face of the heavens and of the seas
unobscured by clouds, even though I had no astronomical
equipment."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With these words, Father Francesco Borghesi (1723-1802) of Mechel
described the reasons which inspired him to invent a unique astronomical
clock which is now in the horological collection of the Museum of
History and Technology.</p>

<p>This complicated mechanism, which performs a multitude of functions, was
designed by Father Francesco Borghesi, a secular priest in Venezia
Tridentina. It was constructed in 1764 under his direction by a
provincial clockmaker named Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla (1702-1789) of
Mocenigo di Rumo. It was the second of two complicated astronomical
clocks which Father Borghesi designed and which Bertolla constructed.
According to contemporary sources, this clock was presented to the
Empress Maria Theresa of Austria soon after its completion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Its history is rather hazy, except for the fact that in 1780 this second
Borghesi timepiece was still in the Imperial Palace in Vienna. The clock
was again noted in 1927 when it was sold at a public auction in New
York.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Subsequently, it was acquired for the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<h3>Development of Astronomical Clocks</h3>


<p>The history of the great theoretical and mechanical achievement which
the Borghesi clock represents has been most adequately covered
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Consideration of the development of equation and
astronomical clocks is required here only for the purpose of relating
the Borghesi timepiece with the other significant developments in this
branch of horology.</p>

<p>The invention of the anchor escapement in about 1670, and the consequent
greater accuracy in time-telling, led to increased preoccupation with
precision. Daily differences in time as recorded by sundials and clocks
became more noticeable. Finally, in the second half of the 17th century,
some attempt was made to construct mechanical clocks combined with
sundials as well as astronomical clocks.</p>

<p>With the improvement of precision time-telling, it became necessary to
reconcile the actual difference between true and mean time. Although a
great variety of time-equation tables were produced, there was a
considerable margin for error in their use. This led to the construction
of mechanical clocks in which the equation of time was automatically
accomplished. A few were produced late in the 17th and early 18th
century at considerable cost and, consequently, with little popularity.
Equation sundials were also developed which were elaborately ingenious,
but they were not completely practical. Inevitably, they were supplanted
by the mechanical equation clock.</p>

<p>Probably the first documented mention of an equation clock is in the
diary of John Evelyn who recorded that in 1666 he visited the Royal
Society where he witnessed a curious clock, which showed the equation of
time, being presented by a certain Mercator. More data on the subject
appeared in the first two decades of the 18th century, when Henry Sully,
Joseph Williamson, Daniel Quare, and Thomas Tompion&mdash;who were among the
foremost English clockmakers of all time&mdash;produced elaborate examples of
these timepieces. Another significant maker was Dowe Williamson, who
became Court Clockmaker to Emperor Charles VI of Austria. In London,
Joseph Williamson produced some of the finest astronomical timepieces of
this type that have been known. The interest in the subject next shifted
to France where many fine examples were produced during the first half
of the 18th century.</p>

<p>Just after the middle of the 18th century, the subject of astronomical
clocks suddenly became a major horological preoccupation in another
region, namely, Austria, where the work in this field was apparently
done exclusively by members of the clergy. The earliest was Father
Philipp Matthäus Hahn (1739-1790) of Württemberg.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Father Hahn
considered the equation of time as only one part of a plan to represent
astronomical occurrences by means of clockwork. In addition to
planetaria and similar mechanisms, Father Hahn produced two
extraordinary astronomical, tall-case clocks, both of which survive in
public museums.</p>

<p class="caption2"> Figure 2.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Portrait of Father Francesco Borghesi</span>,

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Another of the clerical clockmakers was Father Aurelianus à San Daniele
(1728-1782), an Augustine monk in the monastery of the Imperial Court at
Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> His four complicated astronomical clocks, which exist in
museums at present, are comparable to those produced by Father Hahn. The
third cleric was Brother David à San Cajetano (1736-1796) in the same
Augustine order to which Father Aurelianus belonged. He achieved note as
the author of various publications, including <i>Neue Rädergebäude</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
[New Construction of Wheels] relating to planet-wheels, or gear-trains
containing epicyclic elements. He constructed a clock based on an
elaborate astronomical design which was substantially different from the
others. The fourth of the ecclesiasts who designed astronomical clocks
in this period was Father Klein of Prague, who produced a complicated
astronomical timepiece in about 1738.</p>

<p>The fact that such important and outstanding examples of astronomical
clocks were produced exclusively by ecclesiasts in Austria during the
second half of the 18th century is especially significant. It is
particularly so when a fifth cleric is added to the group, also an
Austrian subject although Italian by heritage, in the person of Father
Francesco Borghesi.</p>

<p>Although only Father Borghesi's second astronomical clock is now known,
it is apparent that this example in the Museum of History and Technology
represents an experiment in astronomical time-telling comparable to any
of the timepieces produced by Father Hahn, Father Aurelianus, Brother
David à San Cajetano or Father Klein.</p>

<p>This combination of five clerical clockmakers who lived in the same
region during the same period of time is sufficiently unusual. However,
the fact that each of them apparently worked without association with
any of the others leads to the conjecture that a common factor must have
led them to their individual preoccupation with astronomical horology.
What the link may have been is not apparent from the surviving records
of the lives and works of these clerics. Certainly it was not an
interest in astronomy or clockmaking per se, because other than the
astronomical clocks, none of these horological inventors&mdash;with the
possible exception of Father Hahn&mdash;worked in any other aspect of the
fields of astronomy or horology. However, after a comprehensive study of
Father Borghesi's writings, there is little doubt of the religious basis
of his own inspiration.</p>

<h3>Designer Borghesi</h3>


<p>Father Borghesi's story takes place in the picturesque mountainous
region of what was then known as Venezia Tridentina (since 1947,
Trentino-Alto Adige) in northern Italy, along the Tyrolean border of
Austria. Because of its strategic position as the passage between
Innsbruck and Verona, the possession of the Tridentina was contested
again and again in the European wars, but during Father Borghesi's
lifetime, the Tridentina was under Austrian domination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Panorama</span> of the village of Mechel in the
valley of the Non, birthplace of Father Borghesi.
</p>
</div>

<p>Deep within this mountainous district is the romantic valley of the Non,
or Anáuni, with its great forests and ancient castles. Most maps do not
mark it, and the tourist guides ignore it.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> One of the chief
communities is Cles, with its historic Renaissance buildings. The major
city of the region is Trent on the Adige River, with its surviving Roman
relics and Romanesque and Renaissance architecture.</p>

<p>The little villages scattered throughout the valley of the Non played no
part in history, but such names as Mechel and Mocenigo di Rumo reflect
the interchange of sovereignty. It was in the little village of Mechel
that Francesco Borghesi was born in 1723.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Local records are meager
and inadequate, and many of the details of Borghesi's life must be
assumed. Inasmuch as the village was in a rural, agricultural district,
Borghesi may have come from a family of farmers, vintners, or village
tradesmen. Borghesi sought an education by entering the priesthood and
was ordained a secular priest in Salzburg. He was first assigned as
curate to the village parish of Rumo in the valley of the Non, a short
distance from his birthplace.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Later, he was transferred to his native
Mechel. He was inherently a man of simple tastes and of great piety. He
tended to the needs of his mountain villagers and attended the births,
weddings and deaths of his parishioners. It was during his assignment in
this tiny community that Father Borghesi met and became friendly with
the clockmaker, Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla of nearby Mocenigo di Rumo.</p>

<p>Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla was born in Mocenigo di Rumo, a short
distance from Mechel, in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Nothing is known of his boyhood,
other than the fact that he was mechanically inclined. At the age of 17
he was apprenticed to become a clockmaker with the master, Johann Georg
Butzjäger of Neulengbach, a small village on the edge of the great
Vienna woods.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This region was then part of the domain of the
Archduke of Austria, of which Sankt Pölten was the capital.</p>

Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla upon completion of his 3-year apprenticeship
at Neulengbach, dated December 27, 1722.</p>
</div>

<p>Bertolla began his apprenticeship with Butzjäger under the auspices of
the Corporation of Blacksmiths of Sankt Pölten in 1719. His training was
supervised by two master locksmiths, Johann Christian Winz and Peter
Wisshofer, who were members of the Corporation, and were assigned to
serve as patrons for the apprentice. It was their obligation to make
certain that he received good care and adequate instruction from his
master. While he worked in Butzjäger's shop, Bertolla lived with the
master's family in their home.</p>

<p>Bertolla's 3 years at Neulengbach passed quickly as he sought to absorb
all that his master could teach him. Butzjäger was considered to be a
good craftsman in the region, yet today there is not even a mention of
his name in the lists of clockmakers. He specialized in the production
and repair of "great clocks" which included tall-case, domestic
timepieces, and tower clocks. Butzjäger treated his apprentice well, and
in return Bertolla rewarded him by being diligent and honest. His
subsequent work is sufficient indication that he developed into an
extremely skilled craftsman, and he became the equal of any clockmaker
of his time.</p>

<p>The 3 years of apprenticeship were completed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> on December 27, 1722,
Bertolla received a certificate from the Corporation of Blacksmiths
which assured whomever it might concern of Bertolla's skill, diligence
and honesty, and permitted him to open his own shop as a clockmaker
under the auspices of the Corporation. This document, which has been
preserved by Bertolla's descendants, is an interesting record of the
organization of the trade guilds in the 18th century, and, for that
reason, has been translated from the original German:</p>

<blockquote><p>We, the Superiors and other masters of the honorable
corporation of municipal blacksmiths, armorers, and of smiths,
in the Imperial City of St. Pölten in Austria by the river
Enns, <span class="smcap">Declare by these Presents</span> put in force by this document
to anyone who waits to hear.... That the honorable and able
<span class="smcap">Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla</span> of Rumo in Lentzberg, the Tyrol, on
the 27th day of the month of December of the year 1719 was
consigned as apprentice for three years, in the presence of two
sponsoring masters for the purpose, the honorable Johann
Christian Winz and Peter Wisshofer, both of them master
locksmiths representing the entire honorable Corporation and
others of open shop&mdash;to the honorable <span class="smcap">Johann Georg Butzjäger</span>,
incorporated with us, citizen and master clockmaker for large
clocks in the merchant-village of Neulengbach in Wienerwald, as
his master of the art, would have therefore perfectly and
rightfully worked and learned, and</p>

<p>that afterwards, on the day and year noted at the bottom, he
will be newly declared free and independent before us,
representative of an entire and honorable Corporation and with
open shop, of his above-mentioned master and of the two
sponsoring masters mentioned,</p>

<p>and since he eagerly requested a truthful certificate of
apprenticeship for his honest service as an apprentice and for
his good behavior, and we having great pleasure as well as the
duty of favoring the truth and well knowing that the aforesaid
<span class="smcap">Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla</span> has learned honestly the art of
clockmaking for great clocks from his aforesaid master, and
that he has always behaved with honesty, obedience,
faithfulness and diligence both towards his master and towards
us to our complete satisfaction and, therefore, we cannot in
any manner refuse his request, rather we wish to grant it with
a clear conscience.</p>

<p>Executed in the city of St. Pölten on 27 December 1722.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>His apprenticeship over, Bertolla returned to his native region where he
soon established a reputation for himself as one of the most skillful
clockmakers in the Tridentina and produced timepieces of fine quality in
some quantity. No records have survived concerning his personal life,
but it is believed that he married probably soon after his return. He
had no children of his own. To expand his business, he eventually took
into his shop two nephews, the sons of a brother and a sister, as
apprentices.</p>

<p>Bertolla's work brought him a sufficient number of clients, and he
produced elaborate clocks for his more wealthy patrons.</p>

<p>In 1752, it is recorded that he repaired the great clock in the
campanile of the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Cles,
the regional capital of the valley of the Non. The clock dated probably
from the 16th century, and it seems likely that Bertolla replaced the
original two-wheel train with a three-wheel movement, and that he added
the present anchor escapement.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It is not possible to determine when Father Borghesi first made
Bertolla's acquaintance, but it may be assumed that they had become
friends in the late 1750's.</p>

<p>After he had come to know Bertolla, Father Borghesi apparently spent
many hours in the clockmaker's shop. He was fascinated by mechanics in
any form, and the complications of clockwork particularly intrigued him.
Bertolla was patient with the young priest, explaining the tools he had
and their uses, the clocks he produced or repaired, and the principles
which were involved. Father Borghesi listened willingly and as his
understanding of timepieces grew, his <a id="corr_37_1" name="corr_37_1"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: curiousity">curiosity</ins> increased.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, the priest could not be satisfied with the ordinary
aspects of his friend's work and wanted to learn more. From a casual
pastime, the study of time became an obsession with him. There was but
one recourse: he went back to studying once again. This time it was not
theology, however, but the sciences. Every moment he could spare went
into the perusal of books on mathematics, astronomy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> associated
subjects. He progressed rapidly, driven by his overpowering interest and
aided by his quick intellect.</p>

<p>Little by little, Borghesi managed to acquire the basic texts that
explained this new world to him, probably borrowing them from old
seminary friends. As each new book came into his hands, he devoured it
in his desire to master its contents. He discussed each new principle or
precept that he learned with Bertolla. Together, they attempted to apply
his new learning to the calculations necessary for a timepiece which
would demonstrate the astronomical theories in visual form. Borghesi
taught himself slowly, step by step, and the result was a profound
understanding of astronomical science. He conceived the project of
constructing a great astronomical clock which he felt could be
accomplished by combining Bertolla's mechanical skills with his own
recent mastery of astronomy and mathematics.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>First Borghesi Clock</h3>


<p>It is not difficult to visualize the two men, the priest and the
clockmaker, as they sat together night after night working out their
plans. Father Borghesi would painstakingly outline the astronomical
principles he wished to have the clock exhibit and the mathematical
principles which would be involved to operate them. Bertolla
concentrated on them and tried to transcribe the principles into
functional mechanical terms, visualizing each operation in terms of
wheels and gears. Little by little the two men coordinated the numerous
elements and welded them into an operating entity. They adjourned either
to the stark simplicity of the rectory or, probably more often, to
Bertolla's little home workshop, the priest standing over his friend
while the latter worked at his bench in the dark paneled interior
illuminated only by the several lamps on the work benches.</p>

<p>This first clock which the two men combined to create is a monument to
the great scientific knowledge of the self-taught priest and the
technical ability of the clockmaker&mdash;a unity combining astronomical
science, mechanics, and artistry. The story of the project is told in a
little book, <i>Novissima Ac Perpetua Astronomica...</i>, which Borghesi
later published. Explaining the incentive which inspired him, and the
premises from which he began his work, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>From the foundation of astronomical science long ago,
innumerable [and] repeated observations of both ancient and
modern astronomers, emerged at last from their hiding places.
Made light of by the jests of so many outstanding intellects,
they have so successfully brought to light the paths of the
stars and their motions, which are more complicated to us than
the Gordian knots. Now it is possible for even an amateur in
astronomy, sufficiently instructed, to predict for any given
time not only the mean position of the planets, but also their
true longitude and latitude, and even the true time of their
conjunctions, and their ecliptic oppositions, with all the
attendant circumstances. Yet, until now, no hypothesis has been
devised which would force an automaton to show to us, before
our very eyes, the eclipses of the planets in their true and
certain times.</p>

<p>For though there have been men seeking with all their might to
bind by laws their artificial heavens, by I know not how many
and how great calculations, and to systematize the complexities
of the rotations of celestial bodies; nevertheless, all of
them, as if by common agreement, considered themselves to have
made great contributions to mechanico-theoretical astronomy.
However, they have only attained, even though closely, the mean
locations of the secondary mobiles, and those by a certain
rather crude calculation. Some attained by more, some by less,
but all by some degree of wandering from the truth, either worn
out by the intricacies of the motions, or deceived and
deceiving by the errors of their calculations. This fact those
well know, who, setting about to collect information of this
kind, even those publicized not long ago, with true
astronomical calculation, have been bored to death while
digging out by the most elementary and superficial arithmetical
torture, the worst of fallacies spontaneously erupting from
thence.</p>

<p>It would seem that true calculations alone can be desired in
mechanico-astronomics. Long study had not only convinced me
that an automaton was within the realm of possibility, but that
there were many mechanical systems by which it could be
achieved. I girded myself for a new project and developed it
theoretically from the ground up, but under such unhappy
auspices that not only did all hope fail that anyone would ever
appear who might have seemed willing to set his hand to the
work, but that the new discovery itself was scoffed at by many
as altogether a nightmarish delirium of an unbridled
imagination.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first months of the project must have seemed like an inspired dream
to the two men, and then must have followed a period of hopeless
depression. Bertolla undoubtedly felt many times that the clock was an
aspiration far beyond their combined abilities and means, but the priest
would not be thwarted in his ambition and refused to abandon the
project. He felt that it was a work that they were destined to pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>duce.
Many times, he wrote, he chided and begged and shamed his erstwhile
partner into resuming the project where it had been last abandoned.
Little by little, the first clock began to take form. As each new
difficulty was encountered, the two men would go back over the notes and
sketches to trace the problem to its source. Often a new part of the
mechanism would nullify another which had thus far operated
successfully, and a complete rearrangement would be required.</p>

<p class="caption2">Figure 7.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Title Page</span> of Father Borghesi's first book.
The translation in its entirety is: "The Most Recent, Perpetual,
Astronomical Calendar Clock: Theoretical&mdash;Practical: by means of which
besides the hours, the minutes and seconds; the current year, the month;
the day of the month and the day of the week; the dominical letter,
epact, and thence, the day of all the feastdays, both fixed and movable;
the solar cycle; the golden number; the Roman indiction; the dominant
planet of any year and its sign; the phases of the moon and its mean

sun and moon appear, but also, all solar and lunar eclipses&mdash;both
visible and invisible; as in heaven, so on the clock, they are
conspicuously celebrated in their true times, and those of the past and
those of the future, with their circumstances of time and duration,
magnitude, etc., can be quickly determined. All this was devised and
brought to light by the author, Francesco Borghesi of Anáuni, a secular
priest of Trent, A.A.L.L. &amp; Doctor of Philosophy. (Trent: From the
printshop of Giovanni Battista Monauni, With Permission of Superiors.)"
(<i>Title page reproduced by permission of the Biblioteca della Citta di
Trento.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p style="clear:both;">Again and again, Bertolla threw up his hands in despair and begged
Father Borghesi to abandon the enterprise. He protested that he was not
capable of producing such a complicated mechanism; he had neither the
tools nor the skill. The priest wished to produce a clock such as the
world had never seen before, such as the greatest scientists and
clockmakers of all time had never been able to make. But Bertolla felt
that he was only a provincial craftsman who could not hope to surpass
them all with only his simple tools and training.</p>

<p>In his book on the first clock, <i>Novissima Ac Perpetua Astronomica...</i>,
Father Borghesi wrote that when he had finally come within a few weeks
of the embryo stage in the development of his clock, he was faced with
the problem of bolstering the sagging enthusiasm of Bertolla. The
clockmaker's original enthusiasm had shown promise of great results, but
as the days passed and the problems of the multiplex and generally
unfamiliar apparatus to be forged for the workings of the automaton
became more complex, his ardor decreased. Finally, Bertolla became so
discouraged by the scoffers and frustrated by the fact that the work was
insufficiently organized that Father Borghesi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> wrote that "it almost
became a harder task for me to bolster up by daily opportunity and
importunity the failing patience of the artisan, frightened away from
the work already begun, than it was for me to extract from the inner
recesses of mathematics and astronomy, without light and without a
guide, the whole fabric of the machine itself!"</p>

<p>In spite of Bertolla's protests, Father Borghesi prevailed, reviving his
friend's interest once more until the two were deep in the project
again. Months passed as they worked together on the mechanism and it
seemed as if they lived for no other purpose. Inevitably, Bertolla's
health began to suffer, undermined as it was by the constant nervous
tension, and he eventually became ill from mental strain. He was forced
to spend some time in bed, and for many weeks the subject of the clock
was not discussed. Bertolla's other work, by which he made his living,
suffered and it was several months before he was able to return to his
little shop.</p>

<p>One year passed into another and the work progressed slowly. The first
clock, which easily should have been finished in less than a year, was
not completed until after three full years had passed. However, when the
priest and the clockmaker put the finishing touches to their great
clock, the result surpassed the greatest possible expectations, for it
was truly a masterpiece. Not only did it illustrate the ecliptic
phenomena of the moon, the sun and earth occurring in their proper time,
as well as many other things, but it showed these operations as they
succeeded in proper order, taking place through the centuries.</p>

<p>With mutual feelings of great pride, the two friends surveyed the result
of their three years of endeavor. Bertolla realized that he had reached
a point of maximum achievement in his work. He probably felt that now he
could relax again, that his sleep would no longer be troubled by
confused nightmares of wheels and gears that did not mesh together. Time
was to prove otherwise.</p>


<h4>PUBLISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST CLOCK</h4>

<p>Father Borghesi soon came to the conclusion that it would be desirable
to have a written description to explain the mechanism of the clock and
its many indicators. He thereupon wrote out the story of how the clock
was made, the reasons for embarking on the enterprise, the difficulties
he had encountered, and the success which had crowned his and Bertolla's
mutual labors. Finally, he described the operation of the clock's
mechanism and the functions of its array of indicators.</p>

<p>The little book was written in Latin and only a few copies were printed,
presumably at the priest's own expense, on a handpress by Giovanni
Battista Monauni, printer to the Bishop in Trent. The little volume was
stated by contemporary writers to have been published in 1763, although
no date appears on the title page. The title translated is, in part,
<i>The Most Recent, Perpetual Astronomical Calendar Clock,
Theoretical&mdash;Practical....</i> The work begins with an introduction for the
reader in which Father Borghesi stated that:</p>

<blockquote><p>... the little work, which, as far as I was concerned could
easily have been finished in a year, was only completed after
about three years. Fortunately, however, it was so far beyond
the expectations of most, that not only am I able to foretell
with certainty all the lunar ecliptic phenomena and the solar,
or rather terrestrial, phenomena, carefully worked out in their
true periods, among many other matters exhibited by the
machine; but also, within a few hours, I can exhibit by
altogether tangible evidence to the skeptics and the doubting
those very same phenomena, occurring within the space of many
years, or even centuries, and succeeding one another in proper
order, with their many attendant circumstances. I was not much
concerned about the other eclipses, such as those of Mercury,
Venus, and the other stars wandering through the zodiac, or
about the other solar eclipses from the transit of Mercury or
Venus, since they are altogether undiscernible to the naked
eye, and very few compilers of ephemerides wish them to be
noted, probably for the same reason.</p>

<p>Do not, however, expect, star-loving reader, that here anything
at all that you may wish can be drawn forth as from its source,
for to demand this would be almost the same as to seek to drain
as from a cup all the vast knowledge of the many arithmetical
sciences from the narrow confines of one book. You will
understand how impossible that is when, through prolonged
labor, you have grown somewhat more mature in this kind of
learning.</p>

<p>Wherefore, rather fully, and out of consideration for you, I
have decided, setting aside these prolixities, with completely
synoptic brevity and with all possible clarity to expound for
you simply the proportion of the movements, the description of
the machine, and its usage. As a result, when you have
progressed a little in theoretical mechanics, you will not only
be able to reduce all these things to their astronomical
principles, but you may find the way more smoothly laid out for
you even for perfecting the machine itself. And, thus, you may
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> more effectively encouraged to a successful conclusion. Let
it be so now for you through the following 10 chapters!</p></blockquote>

<p>After these rather hopeful assurances, Father Borghesi proceeded to
provide a detailed description of the clock dial and functions in the 10
short chapters which he had promised, under a separate section entitled
"Synopsis Totius Operis Mechanici," which is translated in its entirety
in the appendix.</p>

<p>As Father Borghesi prepared his little volume about his first clock, and
described its unusual features and outlined its functions, which were
primarily to place in evidence the celestial constellations, it occurred
to him that it would now be easier after the experience he had acquired
with his first timepiece, to construct another clock, which would
present the motions of the two astronomical systems, the Ptolemaic and
the Copernican. In this first book, he promised the reader that he would
undertake the second project. It is fortunate that Father Borghesi
undertook this project for the second clock is the only example of his
work that is known to exist today. Extensive research has not shown what
happened to the first clock, although several sources state that both
timepieces were presented to Empress Maria Theresa sometime between 1764
and 1780.</p>

and Mechel.</p>
</div>

<p>Father Borghesi lost no time in initiating the project of the second
clock. The first and most important step was to inform Bertolla and
enlist his assistance. Bertolla was adamant: he had had enough of
complicated astronomical movements. He was delighted by the prospect of
returning to his former simple life, producing simple, domestic,
elementary movements for his country clients. Father Borghesi begged and
cajoled. The second clock would be a much simpler one to construct, he
persisted. After all, they had gained invaluable experience from the
production of the first clock. Furthermore, he had already completed its
design.</p>

<p>Bertolla apparently <a id="corr_37_2" name="corr_37_2"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: waivered">wavered</ins> in his resolve and, unwillingly and against
his better judgment, he allowed the priest's inducements to prevail.
Once again, the two friends yielded their leisure hours to a study of
the priest's books and drawings as Father Borghesi enthusiastically
elaborated his design for the timepiece, and Bertolla attempted to
transcribe astronomical indications into terms of wheel counts. The
second clock was, as Borghesi had promised, much easier of execution.
Within a year, it was completed and functioned with complete success.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption2">Figure 9.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Another view</span> of the Borghesi clock.</p>
</div>

<p>This is the clock now in the Museum of History and Technology. It is
housed in a tall case of dark-red mahogany veneered on oak, with
restrained carving featuring ribands and foliate motifs. Gilt-brass
decorations flank the face of the hood, which is surmounted by three
gilt-brass finials in the form of orbs. A wide door in the waist may be
opened to attend the weights. The case is 7 feet 8 inches high, 20-1/2
inches wide at the waist, and 14 inches in depth.</p>

<p>The dial is of gilt brass, measuring 21 inches high and 15 inches in
width, with a number of supplementary silvered dials visible through its
openings. Instead of hands, the dial utilizes three concentric rings
moving around a central disc, the indications of which are read at two
bisecting gilt lines inscribed in the glass face. Twelve separate
functions are performed by the chapter ring assembly alone, and there
are 14 openings on the dial. It is estimated that the clock performs 30
separate functions, including striking and chiming. Of the multiple
chapter rings, the outermost is 1-1/8 inches wide, the center ring is
3/8 inch wide, and the innermost ring measures 1-1/4 inches in width.</p>


<h4>THE DIAL-PLATE ENGRAVINGS</h4>

<p>The gilt dial is incised throughout with figures and inscriptions in
engraving of the very finest quality, as is evidenced in the
illustrations. The frontispiece is surmounted at its center by the
crowned double eagle of the House of Hapsburg, indicating the identity
of the sovereign in whose reign it was made, Emperor Francis I or the
Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Below the eagle at either side are
flying cherubs supporting ribands with inscriptions. Centered at the
bottom of the frontispiece immediately above the chapter rings is the
moving silvered orb representing the sun. Surrounding it is a tableau of
the Holy Trinity, with the Virgin Mary being crowned by Christ holding a
cross at the left and God with a sword in hand at the right, and a dove
representing the Holy Spirit hovering over the Virgin's head. Father S.
X. Winters, S.J., considers it reminiscent of the triptych "The
Coronation of the Virgin" by Fra Lippo Lippi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE INSCRIPTIONS</h4>

<p>Beginning with the uppermost part of the frontispiece, there are nine
inscriptions in Latin on the dial plate. The topmost is <i>Franciscvs I
sit plan. Dominator aeternvs.</i> The phrase has reference to Francis I,
who was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, from 1745-1765, and husband of
Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The phrase may be translated as "May
Francis I be the eternal ruler by favor of the planets" or more simply
"Long Live Francis I, Emperor."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Although the dial plate of the
Borghesi clock is inscribed with his name, the records indicate that
the clock was presented to Maria Theresa. Francis I may have already
died before the presentation was made.</p>

<p>From the left to right over the tableau of the Holy Trinity is the
phrase "Lavs sacrosanctae Triadi Vni Deo, et Deiparae" (Praise [be] to
the most Holy Trinity, to the one God, and to the Mother of God).</p>

<p>Within the upper left and right spandrels is inscribed:</p>

<blockquote><p>Isthaec, Signum grande apparvit in Coelo * sancta Dei genitrix
amicta sole * Illibato pede Lvnae et serpentis nigra premens
Cornva * bis senis pvlcherrime Coronata syderibvs * Tempe
indesinenter clavsa, scatvrigo signata * Cedrvs in Libano,
Cypresvs in Monte Sion * Mater pvrae Dilectionis sanctaeqve

procedentis *, gratiae et gloriae circvmdata varietate.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>This inscription is a eulogy to the Virgin Mary assembled from the texts
of Holy Scripture. In addition, each <i>lemma</i>, contained within
asterisks, <a id="corr_37_3" name="corr_37_3"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: carrie">carries</ins> out the chronogram 1764, the year the clock was
completed. Each <i>lemma</i> is translated and identified from the
Douay-Rheims version of the Bible:</p>

<blockquote><p>This woman: a great sign appeared in Heaven (Apocalypse 12:1) *
The Holy Mother of God clothed with the sun (Apocalypse 12:1) *
And with unharmed foot crushing the black horns of the moon
(Apocalypse 12:1) and the serpent (Genesis 3:15) * Most

water] (Song of Songs 4:12) * Like a cedar in Lebanon, and a
cypress tree on Mount Zion; (Ecclesiasticus 24:17) * Mother of
pure love and of holy hope: Beloved daughter of the Eternal
Father, Mother of the Word, Spouse of the Holy Spirit:
(Ecclesiasticus 24:24) * Surrounded with a diversity of grace
and glory (Psalms 44:10).</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
In addition to the inscriptions previously noted on the outer dial
plate, there are three major inscriptions in the central dial. The
outermost states <i>Circulus horarius Soli</i>, <i>Lunae</i>, <i>Fixis</i>, <i>Nodis</i>,
<i>Aestuique marino communis</i> (the hour circle, common to the sun, the
moon, the fixed stars, the nodes and to the sea tide). This inscription
is divided into four parts by the insertion of four divisions for the
day into canonical hours: [<i>Horae</i>] <i>Nocturnae</i> (night hours);
<i>Matutinae</i> (morning hours); <i>Diurnae</i> (daytime hours) and <i>Vespertinae</i>
(evening hours).</p>

<p>The next section of the central dial is inscribed
<i>Intumescite</i>&mdash;<i>Detumescite</i> (rise and fall of the tides) repeated at
intervals of approximately every six hours. Within the next section is
the following inscription, inscribed continuously around the ring:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lege fluunt, refluunt, dormitant hac maris undae: Ad Phoebi et
Phoebes concordia iussa moventur Aequora; discordi iussu
suspensa quiescunt.</p></blockquote>

<p>Translated, this is:</p>

<blockquote><p>By this law the sea waves ebb and flow and lie dormant: When
Phoebus and Diana agree in their commands, the waters are
moved; when they disagree, the waters lie silent.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Within the central boss of the dial plate, the name of the maker is
inscribed:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bvrghesio Doctore, et Bertolla Limatore Annaniensibvs*</p></blockquote>

<p>Translated, this is:</p>

<blockquote><p>[By] Doctor Borghesi and Bertolla, mechanician citizens of
Anáuni.</p></blockquote>


<h4>INDICATORS IN THE FRONTISPIECE</h4>

<p>There are 12 windows in the frontispiece, through each of which appears
an indication relating to time. Beginning at the top of the frontispiece
of the dial, the first opening occurs on the breast of the imperial
eagle. This indicates the dominating planet, represented by its symbol,
and its house.</p>

<p>The opening in the eagle's left claw, labeled "Lit. Dom." is the
dominical letter. The first seven days in the month of January are each
assigned one of the letters <i>a</i> through <i>g</i> in order of appearance. The
letter which coincides with the first Sunday within this period is
called the dominical letter, and it serves for the following year. In
leap year, two letters are required, one to February 29th and the letter
next proceeding for the remainder of the year. This letter is used in
connection with establishing the date of Easter Sunday. The date of
Easter regulates the dates of the other movable feasts.</p>

<p>The eagle's right claw is labeled "Cyc. EpEC" and represents the epact,
or the age of the moon on January 1st. It serves to find the moon's age
by indicating the number of days to be added to each lunar year in order
to complete a solar year. Twelve lunar months are nearly 11 days short
of the solar year, so that the new moons in one year fall 11 days
earlier than they did the preceding year. However, 30 days are deducted
as an intercalary month since the moon has made a revolution in that
time, and the remainder, 3, would be the epact.</p>

<p>Below the imperial eagle two winged cherubs support a riband with three
indictions of the Julian period. This period of 7980 years is the
product derived from multiplying together the sums of 28, which
represents the cycle of the sun; 19, representing the cycle of the moon;
and 15, which represents the Roman indiction. The Julian period is
reckoned to have begun from 4713 B.C. so that the period will be
completed in A.D. 3267. The first of the three openings is marked "Ind.
Rom." or "Roman indiction," which was an edict by the Emperor
Constantine in A.D. 312, providing for the assessment of a property tax
at the beginning of each 15-year cycle. It continues to be used in
ecclesiastical contracts. The second opening, which occurs immediately
below the eagle, is marked "Cyc. Sol." (cycle of the sun). This cycle
takes a period of 28 years, after which the days of the week once again
fall upon the same days of the month as they did during the first year
of the former cycle. There is no relationship with the course of the sun
itself, but was invented for the purpose of determining the dominical
letter which designates the days of the month on which the Sundays occur
during each year of the cycle. Since cycles of the sun date from 9 years
before the Christian era, it is necessary to add the digit 9 to the
digits of the current year and then divide the result by 28. The
quotient is the number of cycles which has passed, and the remainder
will be the year of the cycle answering to the current year. The third
opening on the riband is labeled "Num. Aur." (golden number).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> Meton, an
astronomer of Athens, discovered in 432 B.C. that after a period of 19
years the new and the full moons returned on the same days of the month
as they had before, and this is called the cycle of the moon. The Greeks
were so impressed with this calculation that they had it inscribed in
letters of gold upon stone, hence the golden number. The First Council
of Nicaea in A.D. 325 determined that Meton's cycle was to be used to
regulate the movable feasts of the Church.</p>

<p>Immediately above the chapter rings is an opening through which the orb
of the sun is visible.</p>


<h4>THE CHAPTER-RING ASSEMBLY</h4>

<p>In a separate chapter in his second volume, entitled "Descriptio
Authomatis Summa totius Operis Mechanici" (Description of the
Automaton&mdash;Summary of the Complete Mechanism), Father Borghesi provided
a description of the functions of the various indicators, prefixing it
with the short poem shown in figure 18. He then continues:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the middle of the frontispiece, as at the center of the
universe, the terraqueous globe of the week revolves, with a
daily motion turning from right to left, bringing with it from
the round window the coming day and at the circumference the
circle of hours common to the sun, to the moon, to the fixed
stars, to the head and tail of the dragon, and to the raging
sea.</p>

<p>The second circle revolves the synodic-periodic measure of the
raging sea, the days of the median lunar-synodic age, the signs
and individual degrees of the signs of the distance of the moon
from the middle of the sun within the time of 29 terrestrial
revolutions, hours 12.44.3.13. This circle revolves likewise
from right to left around the center of the earth. In this
second circle, another little orb revolves, bringing with it
the epicycle of the moon, in which the little circle of the
moon (whose illuminated middle always faces towards the sun),
running from left to right through the signs of the anomaly;
within 13 revolutions of the earth, hours 18.39.16. It descends
from apogee to perigee and in just as many others it returns
from perigee to apogee, to be carried down thus to true, back
and front from the longitude and distance from the sun and from
the middle of the earth.</p>

<p>The third circle (on which I have tried to indicate
astronomically-geometrically in their places, the degrees of
lunar latitude both in the south and in the north, and some
fixed stars, those, namely, which can be separated by us from
the moon which goes between) from left to right turns around
the center of the earth, stretching out the head and tail of
the dragon, on the inside above the second circle for noting
and measuring the sun (but I should rather say the earth), and
the eclipses of the moon, within 346 revolutions of the earth,
hours 14.52.23.</p>

<p>The fourth circle, in which the heaven of the fixed stars,
reduced to the correct ascent of our times, the signs of the
zodiac and the individual degrees of the signs, the months of
the year and the single days of the month can be seen, likewise
makes its journey around the earth from left to right in 365
terrestrial revolutions, hours 5.48.56.; that is, within a
median astronomical year. Above this annual orb, the sun, in
its small epicycle, gliding through the 12 signs of the
<a id="corr_37_6" name="corr_37_6"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: anamoly">anomaly</ins>, within the space of 182 terrestrial revolutions, hours
15.6.58., from left to right, falls from apogee to perigee;
and, within the same time, rises from perigee to apogee, and
brings with it, the index, namely its central radius, inhering
to the axis of the equatorial orb and cutting the four greatest
circles from the center.</p>

<p>When the sun has been moved around, Iris shows from six windows
the era, that is, the current year. Two winged youths take
their place next to Iris, carrying the Julian period: namely,
the Roman indiction, the cycle of the sun and the golden
number, on a leaf of paper held between them. The imperial
eagle stands out on top (as if added to the frontispiece)
carrying on its breast the dominating planet and in its talons
the ecclesiastical calends (that is, the dominical letter and
the epact).</p></blockquote>


<h4>ATTACHMENTS FOR ADJUSTMENT</h4>

<p>Two attachments, in the form of small superimposed dials are situated at
the base of the dial plate, at either side and immediately below the
fourth chapter ring. In his second volume, Father Borghesi stated that
they "are not moved from inside the clock, but the one at the right
[inscribed <i>concitat</i> and <i>retardat</i>] serves for loosening
[accelerating] and tightening [retarding] time; that is, the reins of
the perpendicular."</p>

<p>In other words, the purpose of this attachment is for adjusting the
pendulum to make the clock operate fast or slow. The second attachment,
which appears at the left, and which is inscribed "Claudit" (close) and
"Aperit" (open) serves the purpose of "... preparing the mechanism in a
moment, as swiftly as you wish, for sustaining the astronomical
experiments of which you will hear later; when these things have been
done, it restores the mechanism to its natural motion at the same
speed."</p>

<p>This adjustment relates to the final section of Father Borghesi's second
book, entitled "Chronologo-Astronomicus Usus Authomatis"
(Chronological-Astronomical Use of the Automaton), which is translated
from the Latin in its entirety:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>With one glance at this automaton, you can quickly answer these
questions: What hour the sun shows, the moon, any fixed star,
the head and tail of the dragon. Is the sea swelling with
periodic heat [at high tide?] or is it deflated [low tide], or
quiescent? How many days is it from mean new moon or full moon?
By how many signs and degrees is the moon distant from the sun,
and from its nodes? What sign of the zodiac does the sun
occupy, the moon, the head and tail of the dragon? Is the sun
or the moon, in apogee or perigee, ascending or descending?
What is the apparent speed of the sun and of the moon? What is
the apparent magnitude of the solar and lunar diameter, and of
the horizontal parallax of the umbra and penumbra of the earth?
What is the latitude of the moon? Is it north or south? Does
the moon hide [occult eclipse] any of the fixed stars from the
earth dwellers, and which of these does it obscure? Is there a
true new or full moon? Is the sun in eclipse anywhere on earth?
What is the magnitude, and the duration of this eclipse, with
respect to the whole earth? Can it be seen in the north or in
the south? Is the moon in eclipse? Total or partial? Of what
magnitude, etc.? What limb of the moon is obscured? How many
years have passed from a given epoch? Is this year a leap year,
or a common year&mdash;first, second, or third after leap year? What
is the current month of the year, and what day of the month and
of the week? Which of the planets is dominant? What days of the
year do the various feasts fall on, and the movable feasts
during the ecclesiastical year? And many other similar
questions, which I pass over here for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>Besides, this device can be so arranged for any time
whatsoever, past or future, and for the longitude of any
region, and can be so manipulated by hand, that within the
space of a very short time there can be provided in their
proper order, the various orbits of the luminous bodies, their
alternating eclipses, as many as have taken place through the
course of many years, or even from the beginning of the world;
or those that will be seen as long as the world itself shall
last, with all their attendant circumstances (year, month, day,
duration, magnitude, etc.). All these can be seen with great
satisfaction of curiosity and of learning, and hence with great
pleasure to the soul. In the meanwhile, the little bells
continually play, at their proper, respective times. So that,
all exaggeration aside, a thousand years pass, in the sight of
this clock, as one day!</p>

<p>I am aware of your complaints, O star-loving reader&mdash;that my
description is too meager and too succinct. Lay the blame for
this on those cares, hateful both to me and to you, more
pressing, which forbid me and deprive you of a methodical
explanation of the work.</p></blockquote>


<h4>THE CLOCK MOVEMENT</h4>

<p>Father Borghesi specified that the entire mechanism was equal in weight
to a seventh part of a <i>Centenarii Germanici</i>, a Germanic hundredweight.
This is probably the Austrian centner which is equivalent to 123.4615
pounds. Therefore, the clock mechanism weighs approximately 17.6 pounds.</p>

<p>The clock operated for a hundred days and more at a single winding,
according to Father Borghesi, and by means of a pendulum with a leaden
bob weighing 60 Viennese pounds, attached at a height of 5 feet. Father
Borghesi stated the weight of the pendulum to be 60 <i>librarum
Viennensium</i>, but the Viennese libra does not appear among the weights
of the Austrian Empire. However, using the average libra, an ancient
Roman unit of weight equal to 0.7221 pound, it may be assumed that the
driving weight should be approximately 45 pounds.</p>

<p>Father Borghesi, however, does not venture to provide any description
whatsoever of the movement of his second clock in his book. He gave the
following reasons:</p>

<blockquote><p>But beyond this, I entirely omit [a description of] the further
apparatus of the very many wheels, etc., inside the clock which
carry on its functions, lest I become too verbose for some
persons. To explain more thoroughly the internal labyrinth of
the entire mechanism, from which the movement of the circles or
heavens, etc., are derived, would seem to entangle in too many
complicated perplexities.... Therefore, that I might not delay
longer, and perhaps to no purpose, I have thought it better to
leave the whole work to the proportionate calculus of the
arithmeticians and the technical skill of mechanics. If they
have any desire to construct a similar mechanism, they will
follow the aforesaid motions of the heavens, etc., not only by
one means alone but by many, more swiftly through thoughtful
study than by any amount of instruction.</p>

<p>For whoever is well versed in the theory of calculus and sets
to work at any given project, will discover any desired motion
by a thousand and more ways, by one or another gearing of
wheels; which an industrious mechanic will carry out in
actuality and without too much difficulty. Nor is there any
reason for anyone to be discouraged, so long as he is not
disgusted by the amount of labor for there is nothing truer
than the old saying "The favorable gods grant everything to the
assiduous laborer."</p>

<p>Nay, further, even this little work itself can be improved on
and surpassed by new inventions. Otherwise that other old
adage, almost as old as the world, would prove false, "What you
have found already done, you can easily repeat, nor is it
difficult to add to what has already been invented." Relying on
this principle, I have already conceived some new things to be
added to the present little work.</p></blockquote>

<h4>THE BELLS</h4>

<p>There is a discrepancy between Father Borghesi's written description in
his second book of the number of bells and those which currently exist
in the clock. At the present time, there are two sets of bells attached
to the upper part of the movement. While Father Borghesi indicated that
there were two sets of bells in the clock, he described the first set by
stating that:</p>

<blockquote><p>... there are three bells inside the clock: The largest, when
struck by a little hammer at each mean new moon, signifies the
new moon. The smallest indicates in the same way the full moon
at the time of the mean full moon, by automatic sound. When on
the equatorial earth, the sun appears anywhere in eclipse, two
bells (the largest and the medium) sounding together
automatically, announce that eclipse at the time of the mean
new moon. (I think it is evident that eclipses of the sun occur
at new moons and eclipses of the moon at full moon.)</p>

<p>When the moon is eclipsed, the smallest and the medium bells,
simultaneously and automatically, announce the event to the ear
at the time of the mean full moon. Besides, at the proper time
and automatically, the largest of these bells announces the
current solar hour and the smallest bell strikes the quarter
hours.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the clock today, the first set consists of a smaller bell fixed
within a larger one. It is presumably these bells that indicate the
eclipses and also strike the hours and quarter hours. A pull cord
attached to the striking mechanism repeats the current hour and quarter
hours at will. The second set consists of nine meshed bells struck with
individual hammers operated by means of a pinned cylinder as in a music
box. On the hour, the chimes play one of two melodies, which may be
changed at will. While not identified, these appear to be Tyrolean folk
melodies. The largest of this set of bells is dissimilar to the other
chimes, and may be the third bell described by Father Borghesi to
signify the new moon.</p>


<h4>CHRONOGRAMS</h4>

<p>One of the most curious aspects of the second clock produced by Father
Borghesi and Bertolla, as well as of the second published volume, is the
presence of chronograms which occur repeatedly on the clock dial and
throughout the <i>Novissimum Theorico-Practicum Astronomicum Authoma</i> from
the title page to the end of the book. Interestingly enough, Father
Borghesi did not utilize this device even once in his first little book.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i051.png" width="600" height="315" alt="Figure 18.&mdash;A chronogram in the text of Father Borghesi&#39;s
second volume, indicating the year 1764. The poem is translated as: &quot;In
the Mount of &#39;Anáuni,&#39; the inscrutable heavens are led, You learn from
these all the labors of the sun and the moon. Here you are shown and
hear the conjunction of the moon: And a bell brings to the ears by its
sound, all eclipses.&quot;" title="Figure 18." />

</div>

<p>Webster defines a chronogram as an inscription, sentence, or phrase in
which certain letters express a date or epoch. The method used by Father
Borghesi for forming chronograms was a simple one. He used combinations
of uppercase and lowercase letters in two sizes in the inscriptions on
the clock dial and in his writings. At first this curious combination in
the inscriptions on the dial plate was a source of considerable
speculation. The extremely fine quality of the engraving and artistry
was such that these combinations could only be deliberate in nature and
not the accidental whims or accidents of the engraver. Accordingly, they
must be chronographic in intention. Such proved to be the case.</p>

<p>Borghesi used the larger size of uppercase <a id="corr_37_7" name="corr_37_7"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: letter">letters</ins> to form the
chronogram, and each chronogram was complete within a phrase or line. He
accomplished this by using for this purpose those letters of the
alphabet which form the Roman numerals. The uppercase letters found
within words are copied off in the order in which they appear in the
inscription or phrase. These are then converted into their numerical
equivalents, and totaled. Taking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> uppermost inscription on the clock
dial as the first example:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">FranCIsCVs I sIt pLan. DoMInator aeternVs</span><br />
</p>

<p>The letters which are intended to form the chronogram are:</p>

<p class="mono">
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">C&nbsp; I&nbsp; C&nbsp; V I I&nbsp; L&nbsp; D&nbsp; &nbsp; M&nbsp; I V</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">100 1 100 5 1 1 50 500 1000 1 5</span><br />
</p>

<p>These figures added together total 1764.</p>

<p>The second inscription on the clock dial which forms a chronogram is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">LaVs saCrosanCtae TrIaDI VnI Deo, et DeIparae</span><br />
<br />
<span class="mono" style="margin-left: 2.5em;">L V&nbsp; C&nbsp; &nbsp;C&nbsp; I&nbsp; D&nbsp; I V I&nbsp; D&nbsp; &nbsp;D&nbsp; I</span><br />
<br />
<span class="mono" style="margin-left: 2em;">50 5 100 100 1 500 1 5 1 500 500 1 = 1764.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The third inscription required a little more planning, because of its
greater length. Accordingly, Father Borghesi divided it into nine parts,
each of which is separated from the other by means of asterisks. Each of
the nine parts of the inscription formed a chronogram which, in every
instance, totals to the date 1764, the year in which the second clock
was completed. The same procedure was followed with the inscriptions in
the lower left and the lower right corners of the dial as well as with
the maker's inscription within the central disk. This inscription is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">BVrghesIo DoCtore, et BertoLLa LIMatore AnnanIensIbVs</span><br />
<br />
<span class="mono" style="margin-left: 2em;">V I&nbsp; D&nbsp; &nbsp;C&nbsp; L&nbsp; L&nbsp; L &nbsp;I&nbsp; &nbsp;M&nbsp;  I I V</span><br />
<br />
<span class="mono" style="margin-left: 2em;">5 1 500 100 50 50 50 1 1000 1 1 5 = 1764.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The inscriptions within the chapter ring are not utilized for
chronograms, however. It is apparent that Father Borghesi was required
to make a most careful selection of the texts for his inscriptions in
order that none of the phrases included any additional letters which
formed Roman numerals than would total to the date he desired to
indicate, namely, 1764. Where it was necessary, he employed an asterisk
to separate parts of texts so that each would produce the same total.
Any letter that did not form a Roman numeral, even if capitalized or
used in a larger size, did not interfere with the formation of the
chronograms.</p>

<p>In spite of his ingenuity in designing a text which would include only
such of the letters representing the Roman numerals which would provide
the chronograms for 1764, Father Borghesi experienced some difficulties,
particularly in place names. He accordingly changed them in order to
avoid the inclusion of letters that would have disturbed his totals.
Examples are MEGGL instead of MECHL, which had an extra C, and RVNNO
instead of RVMO, which had an extra M.</p>


<h4>PUBLISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND CLOCK</h4>

<p>When the clock had been completed and proved to work successfully,
Borghesi once more reduced a description of the clock and its function
to published form in a second little volume published by Monauni. This
second work was also in Latin, the title of which is translated as <i>The
Most Recent Theoretical-Practical Astronomical Clock According to the
Equally Most Recent System of the World</i>. As with his first book, Father
Borghesi devoted a number of pages to a preface addressed to the reader,
which is translated from the Latin:</p>

<blockquote><p>This mechanical instrument was far from being ready for public
notice. A great deal of time and work remained to produce a
machine of this new system from the very foundations; then, by
a most accurate calculation to bring the motions of many wheels
up-to-date with the most recent astronomical observations; and,
finally, to fashion it with the craftsman's file, often enough
with a weary hand. All this work I had performed eagerly, so
that, while in my room, I might contemplate leisurely, both day
and night, the true face of the heavens and the seas unobscured
by clouds, even though I had no astronomical equipment. But,
then I remembered that, in my book on the first clock, I had
promised a description of a new (at least, as far as is known
to me) clock. Moreover, friends with astronomical interest, who
took part in the oft-repeated astronomical experiments
concerning this clock, persuaded me that the intellectual world
would enjoy having a greater knowledge and a description of
this work. However, it was not only the promises nor the
desires of many which moved me to write this work, but I also
thought it was necessary to set forth, before the description
of the clock, an exposition of the astronomical system
according to which this clock was constructed, so that the
complete work would be evident to all. I was concerned about
making this timepiece more acceptable and more understandable
to those people who are far distant and unable to see it, so
that this present exposition would obtain credulity among all.
I could find no better method than to set forth for the reader
the theory of the universe which I figured out after many
sleepless nights.</p>

<p>In testing this theory day after day, it not only appeared to
be complete, and true, but each day it appeared more
conformable to reality; it captured my mind in such a way that
I finally adhered to it. I desired, while I lived, to erect
this work as a monument to the theory. To do this, I digressed
a bit from the true-to-life pattern to the mechanical order so
that I could transfer all the movements of the heavens, etc.
(which I enjoyed thinking about more), to the plane surface of
the clock's face. In this way, the ecliptical spectacles of the
stars, etc., would appear at their proper times clearly before
the eyes of the viewer. I could also avoid many difficulties
which otherwise, perhaps, even the hands of the most skillful
craftsmen could never solve.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p style="clear: both;">You ought to know, therefore, that as a result of my nightly
meditations, I have rejected, after much consideration, all the
explanations of the universe thus far published. All other
theories of the make-up of the universe, however admirable, and
however many there are, turn the sun and earth around in an
ecliptic in an annual movement. Thus, Philolaus was the first
to move the earth from the center of the universe and move it
through the void; afterwards, Aristarchus of Samos and then
Copernicus moved the earth with the moon. The Egyptians, as
well as Pythagoras, Ptolemy, Tycho, Riciolus, Longomontanus,
etc., thought that the sun moved through the degrees of the
ecliptic each year. But I attributed this movement to neither
earth nor sun for the movement of both is only apparent. I did
not vainly surmise the annual equilibrium in all astronomical
observations to be from the daily movement of the same axis
moved at the poles of the heavens. Nor, in like manner, is
there a better way to satisfy physical experiments. To you,
then, most cultured reader: If you, perhaps, can make any use
or draw pleasure from this most faithful description of my new
theory and the mechanical instrument, refer it first to God on
High from whom is everything that is best, and then to those
avidly awaiting this little work. Lastly, if you find any
statement less fitting; in your humanity, do not disdain to
excuse it.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Borghesian Theory of the Universe</h3>


<p>In Father Borghesi's second volume, there is a separate chapter entitled
"An Exposition of the Latest Theory of the Universe." This follows the
introduction to the reader, and in it Father Borghesi proposed:</p>

<blockquote><p>That you might rightly conceive my new <a id="corr_37_8" name="corr_37_8"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: sytem">system</ins> of the world and
mechanically, as it were, construct it, imagine for yourself,
beneath that most happy seat of the Blessed and above all other
heavens, a kind of spherical convexity, everywhere equidistant
from the center of the earth, and endowed with absolutely no
motion.</p>

<p>On the inside, at two points diametrically opposite each other,
this convexity has two most sturdy poles (to speak
mechanically), projecting towards the center (which you call
the poles of the heavens), and the largest immobile semicircle,
in some manner is drawn from the center of one pole to the
center of the other. This semicircle in the middle, namely at a
point equidistant from each pole, is thought to be secured by
some sign, for example, by that "o," for arranging more
perceptibly the seat of the sun (as will be shown later). This
much must be conceived first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>You must understand that imposed on these poles is the first
mobile [Primum Mobile], everywhere convex, and divided, into 12
equal parts [Dodecatemoria], by the 6 greatest circles,
intersecting each other at the centers of the poles. Then it is
divided by another equally great circle, everywhere equidistant
from the poles, into two hemispheres. One hemisphere of 12
parts, proceeding in order from west [setting] to east [rising]
should be assigned the respective signs of the zodiac; that is,
one to Aries, the next to Taurus, and so on, etc. The circle
which cuts those 12 parts transversely in the middle, you call
the ecliptic. Then, these capital spaces of the Primum Mobile
are subdivided by degrees, minutes, etc., both in longitude and
in latitude, so that this heaven represents a kind of great
spherical net, extended to capture the longitude and latitude
of the stars, and Mobile on the aforementioned poles. Note,
however (and this is almost the leading point of <a id="corr_37_9" name="corr_37_9"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: they">the</ins> system),
in that circle of longitude which divides the sign of Gemini
from Cancer and Arcitenens [Sagittarius] from Capricorn, you
must conceive two points, directly opposite each other and
removed about twenty-three and a half degrees from the poles:
Boreal [the northern] between Gemini and Cancer; Austral [the
<a id="corr_37_10" name="corr_37_10"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Closing bracket added">southern]</ins> between Sagittarius and Capricorn. These two points
by some power (imagine it is magnetic power), equal between
them, hold the terraqueous orb suspended in the middle, by
acting on the axis of the same orb (imagine it is iron) in such
a way that the earth is continually drawn to those two points
as to two opposite centers. It is never nearer to one, for as
it is about to move towards one, the opposite power is
constantly drawing it back. Thus, both those points and the
axis of the earth are <a id="corr_37_11" name="corr_37_11"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: alway">always</ins> held in one common line, wherever
those points happen to be carried by the rotation of this
heaven.</p>

<p>Again, it is necessary for you to conceive in this heaven,
first, two great circles, bisecting each other at right angles
in the centers of these two magnets. One of these circles,
passing through the first point of Aries and Libra in the
ecliptic, is called equinoctial colure: the other circle,
passing consequently between the first point of Cancer and
Capricorn, is called solstitial colure. Beneath these are
likewise imagined many other great circles, in the centers of
the magnets dividing crosswise in the shape of an "X." But if,
receding from these magnets, you describe circles (parallel to
each other and ever greater and greater, up to the greatest
circle which you will perceive is called the equator),
equidistant from each magnet and obliquely splitting the
ecliptic in the equinoctial colure, you can then behold a
great, new, woven net in this heaven of the Primum Mobile. This
net most beautifully expands to extract the straight ascent and
descent of the stars, etc., from the vast ocean of the heavens,
catching the straight ascent in the greatest circles and, in
other unequal circles, parallel to each other and obliquely
cutting across, most safely catching the descent.</p>

<h5>GLOSSARY</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Anomolia</span> or anomaly, is the angular distance of a planet from
its perihelion (that point of the orbit of a planet which is
nearest to the sun) as seen from the sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aequinoctium</span> or the equinox, is the time in which days and
nights are equal in the space of hours. There are two
equinoxes: the spring equinox&mdash;c. 8 calends of April in the
sign of Aries; and the fall equinox&mdash;c. 10 calends of October
in the sign of Libra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aeras</span> is derived from <i>aera</i>, <i>aerae</i>, which originally meant a
given number, usually used in regard to money. The word was
later extended to mean a number used in any calculation, and
finally it came to mean a certain time from which subsequent
times were counted, e.g., <i>Anno Domini</i>, after the Birth of
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coluri</span> or the Colures, which are two circles in the heavenly
sphere, passing through the poles of the world and cutting each
other at right angles: the one passes through the equinoctial
points of Aries and Libra and is called <i>Colurus
Aequinoctiorum</i> or equinoctial colure; the other touches the
<i>solstitialia</i> of Cancer and Capricorn and is called <i>Colurus
Solstitiorum</i> or solstitial colure. They are called <i>Colurus</i>,
which is translated as "mutilated tails," for the part which
emerges in the Antarctic is not visible and is quasitruncated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecliptica</span> or the ecliptic, is an imaginary line in the heavens
in which the sun was supposed to have performed its annual
course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epicyclus</span> or epicycle, is a small orb which, being fixed in the
deferent of a planet, is carried along with its motion and yet,
with its own peculiar motion, carries the body of the planet
fastened to it round about its proper center.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iris</span> or the rainbow. In mythology, Iris was the daughter of
Thaumatis and Electra, messenger of Juno of the goddesses and
Jove of the gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solstitium</span> or the solstice, is that time when the sun seems to
stand still for a short time: when the sign of Cancer enters
the month of June (equivalent to the summer solstice, when the
sun begins to recede from us); and when the sign of Capricorn
enters the month of December (equivalent to the winter
solstice, when the sun begins to accede to us).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Immediately below the Primum Mobile place the heaven of the
fixed stars (and, that the idea might be clearer), revolving
separately on the same poles on which the Primum Mobile
revolves. Through this heaven, the filaments of the little
nets, etc., seem to the eyes of you on earth as if they shine.
In this heaven, you should conceive in their fixed places, the
fixed stars, a proportionate, inviolable distance from each
other, and, indeed, if you will, the heavenly images, etc.,
depicted, and all carried along at the same time with their
heaven by one motion.</p>

<p>Conceive a straight line running from the center of the earth
to that sign "o" noted in the semicircle of the supreme
immobile heaven. On this line, greatly below the heaven of the
fixed stars, place the center of the solar epicycle, holding an
area in common with the ecliptic and subject to absolutely no
motions, but at such a distance from the center of the earth
that the semidiameter of the earth has little, if any,
proportion with the distance of the solar epicycle from the
earth. Around the sun, moving continually in this epicycle (its
immobile palace) through the degrees of the anomaly, you can
revolve, with motions proportionate to the system, the five
planets: Mercury and Venus (the nearest barons of the sun),
then Mars, Jupiter and, most remote, Saturn, with its
respective satellites, etc., <a id="corr_37_13" name="corr_37_13"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: excentrically">eccentrically</ins> surrounding the
earth itself and the moon in their immense ambit and wandering
by their proper motions through the zodiac.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, not far from the earth you should imagine
fabricated, as from most refined crystal, the heaven of the
moon everywhere equidistant from the center of the earth and
revolving separately on the same poles (prolonged even to this
place) on which the Primum Mobile and the heaven of the fixed
stars revolve. In the middle of this, that is, in some point
equally removed from the poles, you place the center of the
lunar epicycle, movable also by the common rotation of the
lunar heaven. I refrain from the other movements of the moon in
latitude, etc., as also those of the five planets, etc., which
the theory in no way excludes, lest by a variety of congested
motions explained too abundantly, either you might be confused
about the fundamental concept of the system or, while adorning
the theory and trying to embellish the least things more
widely, you might reject also the things which are capital.</p>

<p>Here you already have the whole machine, but still inert and to
be animated for the first time by motions accommodated to the
system. Nevertheless, before I assign motion to the individual
parts of the world, so that the thing might later appear more
clearly to you, I arrange all things thus: first, as if by
hand, I turn the Primum Mobile until the Boreal magnetic point
comes to the level or the area of the semicircle described in
the supreme immobile convexity; then I turn the heaven of the
fixed stars until, for example, the heel of Castor (a star of
the third magnitude), almost in the ecliptic and indeed in our
time not far distant from the solstitial colure, likewise falls
nearly at the level of the aforesaid semicircle. Later, I turn
the lunar heaven until I bring the center of the lunar epicycle
to the same level. Then, I turn the earth until some
predetermined city, for example, Trent, situated in the
northern zone with a latitude of about forty-six degrees, is
brought to the oft-mentioned level.</p>

<p>From things arranged in this way and from what has gone before,
it is evident (with the motions of the luminaries in epicycles
left out, however, lest you be distracted by the explanation)
that at Trent, just as in the whole northern hemisphere, it is
the summer solstice; and, conversely, in the southern
hemisphere, it is the winter solstice. The reason is because
the northern magnetic point together with the northern half of
the earthly axis is at its highest point towards the sun,
immovably residing in a line sent through the level of the
highest semicircle; and, conversely, the southern magnetic
point with the corresponding half of the axis is most removed
from the same. It further follows, that noonday and the new
moon coincide, and the heel of Castor almost reaches the
summit, etc.</p>

<p>Now, beginning from this hypothetical situation of the whole
world as from the root of the motions, I move all things in
their circles so <a id="corr_37_12" name="corr_37_12"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: than">that</ins> the earth turns on its axis with a
revolving motion from west to east in each 24 hours of median
time. The lunar heaven completes one circle around its poles
likewise from west to east in the time of 29 terrestrial
revolutions, hours 12.44.3.13.1. The sphere of the fixed stars
on the same poles revolves once from east to west within 365
revolutions of the earth, hours 6.9.29.1. The Primum Mobile on
the poles (common to the heaven of the fixed stars and the
heaven of the moon), is moved once in the same way from east to
west, a little faster, however, than the heaven of the fixed
stars, yet within 365 revolutions of the earth, hours 5.48.56;
that is, within a median astronomical year.</p>

<p>Now, behold for yourself a new world supported on new poles and
provided with new motions and laws. Now you, reader and lover
of the stars, turn it, and revolve it as long as it pleases
you, and compare it astronomically and physically with the
Copernican or the Tychonian systems or with whatever one
pleases you more, and judge which one seems more consonant with
nature when all things are examined. But if you aren't able to
reconcile this theory with some astronomical observations or
physical experiments and think it should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> eliminated from
the group of theories, see that I might know this while life is
still my companion, so that I might think with you, if this is
possible. Also, so that, in gratitude for the detected or
perhaps hidden error, I might speak or write, and you won't
have to shout in vain in bold ridicule and with no applause
after the fleeing shades of the dead and the mute ashes. But,
if you object that the daily motion of the revolving earth and
the annual motion of its whirling axis do not sufficiently
agree with certain texts of Sacred Scripture, and if those
things which the Copernicans and the Longomontanists say do not
convince you, then reject my whole system as an old wives'
tale.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Last Years</h3>


<p>There is a break in the story of Borghesi and Bertolla for the next five
years. The second clock may have been the last project on which the
priest and the clockmaker worked together, for very good reasons. The
two clocks must have represented a considerable financial investment in
materials and in time, and neither of the men was in sufficiently
affluent circumstances to undertake the luxury of such a hobby without
some form of recompense. The publication of the two little volumes must
have also been done at Father Borghesi's expense. The income of the
parish priest in a small mountain village could not have been equal to
the relatively great costs of the projects that had been completed. It
seems probable that the priest attempted to sell his clocks to a wealthy
patron, perhaps the Baron of Cles, or he may have attempted to obtain
some form of recompense for the continuation of his research. However,
no records can be found of such patronage if it existed. If Borghesi had
received financial assistance while the projects were in progress, he
would certainly have made adequate mention of the patron's name and
assistance in one or the other of the two volumes which he
published.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The next record relating to Borghesi which has been found is the
description of a letter written by an anonymous mathematician late in
1768 or early in 1769. It was 28 pages in length, written in Latin, in
the form of a reply to the writer's brother, on the subject of the clock
invented by Borghesi. It consisted primarily of a criticism launched
against Borghesi's first little volume published in 1763.</p>

<p>The anonymous letter is without date, place, or signature. This writer
claimed that Father Borghesi had made many errors in his book,
presumably in the description of the clock's functions, and in the basic
theories upon which the priest had predicated his research. No complete
copy of the letter's text has been found for study, although it is
described at length in Tovazzi's <i>Biblioteca Tirolese</i>. Tovazzi noted
that four copies of the letter existed at that time, and that he
personally had filed one in the Biblioteca di Cles in Trent. However,
every attempt to locate a copy at the present time has been
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>If the anonymous letter was brought to the attention of Father Borghesi,
it must have introduced a disturbing note into his life and cost the
priest many unhappy moments. He was not, however, dissuaded from his
preoccupation with horology. Several years later, in 1773, Father
Borghesi was working on yet another astronomical clock, this time
presumably without the assistance of Bertolla. This third clock was
reported by Tovazzi to have been "of minimum expense but of maximum
ingenuity."</p>

<p>No subsequent information relating to it has come to light, and there is
no record that it was actually completed.</p>

<p>Again there is a period of silence in the life of Father Borghesi which
no amount of research has yet been able to pierce. Whatever the
circumstances may have been, it is reported by several of the sources
noted that both the first and the second clock did, in fact, become the
property of the Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna. The presentation was
made sometime during the period between the completion of the second
clock in 1764 and the year 1780. There is some discrepancy in the
contemporary accounts as to whether Father Borghesi presented one or two
clocks to the Empress, but all the sources with but one exception record
that both clocks were acquired by the Empress.</p>

<p>It is doubtful that Father Borghesi had originally intended to give his
clocks to the Empress at the time that they were made, for he would most
certainly have made some mention of such an intention in the two little
volumes which he published about them. If he saw the letter published by
the anonymous mathematician in late 1768 or 1769, it is possible that he
decided to make the presentation in expiation of his sense of guilt for
the amount of his time which the creation of the timepieces had
consumed. On the other hand, it is just as possible that Father Borghesi
may have forwarded copies of his two little volumes to the Imperial
Court at Vienna, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> Empress expressed a desire to acquire the
clocks.</p>

<p>Father Tovazzi states that in 1780 "the clock invented by him [Borghesi]
was preserved in Vienna, Austria, at the Imperial Court from which the
inventor was receiving an annual pension of 400 florins." No records in
the Palace archives relating to the clock have yet been found, nor
records of payment of an annuity to Father Borghesi. However, a more
exhaustive investigation of the Furniture Depository of the Imperial
Court may bring forth related records. It was the implication in Father
Tovazzi's account that the second clock had been presented to the
Empress prior to the publication of the anonymous, critical letter in
1768 or 1769. He believed that it was envy of Father Borghesi's
ingenuity, fame and financial benefit that had caused the anonymous
mathematician to publish his letter, for Tovazzi asked "Who would have
encountered opposition to such a marvel? Envy is not yet dead, and has
always reigned."</p>

<p>This last-mentioned theory about the presentation may be the most likely
one. Some evidence may be found in the second clock itself which bears
out this assumption. The multiple chapter ring, with its many
inscriptions, is engraved and silvered in a relatively crude manner,
presumably by Bertolla himself. The main dial plate, however, which is
of gilt brass, is engraved with the utmost skill by one of the great
masters of the art. The inscription below the Imperial Hapsburg eagle
relates to Francis I, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. It is entirely
possible that although Father Borghesi originally had no intention of
giving the clock to the Emperor or the Empress at the time that it was
made, he later changed his mind. Accordingly, he may have commissioned a
master engraver, possibly in Trent or in Vienna itself, to produce a
dial plate which would be of such a quality as to be worthy of the
Emperor himself. If so, this was done shortly after the clock was
completed, for the Emperor died in August of the following year. Perhaps
by the time that the clock was ready, the Emperor had already died, and
Father Borghesi gave the clock instead to Maria Theresa without revising
the inscription.</p>

<p>The acceptance of the clocks by the Empress, and the annuity which was
his reward, would have constituted considerable honor even for one of
the foremost clockmakers of the Empire, but for a humble parish priest
in a little village, such notable Imperial recognition was overwhelming.
Possibly as a result of it, a change was noted in Father Borghesi in the
next few years. His conscience began to bother him, and he began to
question whether he had done right in spending so much of his time and
thought on his horological research. He became more and more confused in
his own mind. Had he spent too much time in mechanical studies to the
neglect of his ecclesiastical duties? If this had been the case, he had
committed the most grievous sin.</p>

<p>Exaggerated though these thoughts may appear, they were undoubtedly of
the most critical importance to the middle-aged priest. His mental
turbulence and confusion increased daily, and it soon became apparent to
others around him. By June 1779, he was completely in the grip of his
obsession, and his parishioners began to whisper amongst themselves that
their pastor was being tortured by the devil. They were unable to help
him, and he became more and more preoccupied with his problem. The years
passed slowly as the pastor became more vague and more tortured by his
conscience.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>There probably was continued contact between Father Borghesi and
Bertolla for at least some time after the development of his illness.
Bertolla had retired from active work, but continued to pursue his
interests in his clockshop as much as his health and advanced years
permitted. A clock which he made at the age of 80 survives and is
described and illustrated in the following section on "The Clocks of
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla." Finally, on January 15, 1789, Bertolla
passed away and Father Borghesi was left alone, deprived of the
companionship he had enjoyed with the older man for the past two or
three decades. One of Bertolla's nephews continued to work in the master
clockmaker's workshop, but there did not appear to be any association
between the younger man and Father Borghesi.</p>

<p>At last, in 1794, Father Borghesi lost his sanity completely, and he was
forced to relinquish his pastoral duties to a curate. For the remaining
eight years of his life, he continued to live in the rectory of the
little parish church in Mechel where most of his life had been spent,
his needs undoubtedly attended by the parishioners he could no longer
serve. During this period, until his death at the age of 79 on June 12,
1802, Father Borghesi lived on, oblivious of those around him.
Seemingly, he retired to another world; perhaps to that universe which
he had tried to reproduce in his second clock.</p>

</div>

<p>The ingenuity displayed in the Borghesi clock by its constructor,
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla, requires a consideration of the other
examples of his work that have survived. The most important of his
clocks are probably the one in the Episcopal Palace at Trent and another
made for the Baron of Cles.</p>

<p>The one which survives in the Episcopal Palace to the present time, is
extremely tall and is housed in an elaborately decorated narrow case of
black or ebonized wood approximately 9 to 10 feet in height. The upper
part of the case is decorated with elaborately carved and gilt rococo
motifs. The movement operates for one year at a winding, indicates and
strikes the hours, and shows the lunar phases. It has an alarm, and will
repeat the strike at will, indicating the number of the past hour and
the quarters. The gilt brass dial is decorated with silver-foliated
scrollwork in relief at the corners, inside the chapter ring, and within
the broken arch. Featured above the chapter ring is the coat of arms,
executed in silver, of the patron for whom the clock was made,
Cristoforo Sizzo di Noris. Di Noris was Bishop of Trent for 13 years,
from 1763 to 1776.</p>

<p>The clock which Bertolla made for the Baron of Cles is a tall, narrow,
case clock of ebony or ebonized pearwood which is approximately 9-1/2
feet in height. The decoration of the case is considerably more
conservative than the one made for Di Noris, but the black wood is
decorated with silver trim and carved designs in the wood itself. The
dial is decorated with silver scrollwork and spandrels within and around
a raised chapter ring. The clock operates for one month at each winding,
has an alarm, indicates and strikes the hours, and will repeat the
quarters. This handsome timepiece is still in the possession of the
descendants of the Baron of Cles.</p>

<p>According to Pippa,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> certain characteristics become apparent in a
study of the surviving clocks by Bertolla. The tall-case clocks are
narrow and range in height from 7-3/4 feet to 10-1/2 feet. The cases had
this excessive height in order to obtain the greatest fall for the month
and year movements which Bertolla constructed. For the weight assembly,
he substituted a drum wound with a key at the point of the driving wheel
in place of the customary pulley. The addition of an intermediate wheel
augmented the drop of the weight.</p>

<p>Bertolla's movements were solidly constructed from well-hammered brass
and iron. He favored the recoil anchor escapement in his clocks and the
Graham dead-beat anchor escapement with a seconds' pendulum. The
escapement was not always placed in the traditional location in the
upper center between the plates. Bertolla occasionally displaced the
pendulum to one side, to the lower part of the movement or placed it
entirely between two other small plates.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>He utilized every type of striking work, including the music-box
cylinder common in the clocks of the Black Forest and the rack and
snail. Bertolla most frequently employed the hour strike and <i>grand
sonnerie</i>. He often used a single hammer on two bells of different sound
with the rack and snail. An example of this type is the clock he
produced at the age of 80. To achieve the necessary axis of rotation for
the hammer, which is perpendicular to the plate when it strikes the
hours, it moves to an oblique position and displaces one of the two long
pins in an elongated opening.</p>

<p>Bertolla's dial plates were generally well executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> with a raised or
separate chapter ring applied to a brass or copper plate, such as a
copper-plate <i>repoussé</i> and gilt with baroque motifs, or upon a smooth
brass plate with spandrels of <i>repoussé</i> work usually of silver, in
relief and attached. The engraving of the chapter rings was excellent.
The hands were well executed in steel or perforated bronze, and
occasionally of <i>repoussé</i> copper; gilt was applied to the hands made of
forged steel.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">In the course of time, Bertolla's home workshop passed from one
generation to another within the family. Inevitably, it underwent many
modifications until the only original part of the building that remained
intact from Bertolla's time was his clockshop.</p>

<p>Within the last few years, the workshop room was acquired complete with
contents from Bertolla's descendants, and installed in the Museo
Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnica in Milan as an exhibit of a
typical 18th-century clockmaker's shop. The original workshop was
dismantled in Mocenigo di Rumo and completely rebuilt in the museum,
including the walls, ceiling and floor. The paneling and woodwork of the
walls and ceiling, which have been preserved intact, are hand-cut fir,
with columns, trim and moldings carved by hand. A small painting is
featured in the center of the coffered ceiling. The original shop
benches and chests of drawers are set around the reconstructed shop and
Bertolla's tools and equipment laid out as they had been originally.
Other clockmaker's tools and equipment in the museum's collection are
also displayed. Approximately 40 percent of the tools are the original
items<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> from Bertolla's shop. Parts of clocks and works in progress are
on view on the benches as they were in Bertolla's time.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Also
preserved in the museum are sketches found in Bertolla's manuscripts,

<p>The shop contains two completed clocks made by Bertolla. One is a
weight-driven lantern clock typical of the 18th century, Italian style
with brass dial, plates and posts, anchor escapement, and striking
work. The dial is engraved in the usual style of Bertolla's baroque
design, and the hands are of pierced bronze. Another clock associated
with Bertolla and found in the shop, was made by his nephew, Alessandro
Bertolla, who worked in Venice after his apprenticeship with his uncle
had been completed. This clock is a regulator with a seconds' pendulum
and sweep hand on an enameled dial. The original case has not survived.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">One of the most interesting of Bertolla's clocks, and probably the last
one which he produced, was found in his workshop. This timepiece
indicates the hours, minutes and quarters by means of a single hand or
index. The weight-driven clock strikes the hours and quarters on two
bells with a single hammer. The chapter ring, which is soldered to the
dial plate, is marked for the minutes on the outer rim and for the four
quarters inside it. Over the center of it, is a semicircular opening in
the dial plate through which is visible a revolving disk attached behind
the dial plate. This disk is marked with the hours and revolves from
right to left, the current hour being indicated by a projection from the
minute ring. The brass dial plate is engraved with simple floral
designs in the corners and around the broken arch. There is no
comparison between this crude and simple decoration and the extremely
fine quality of the engraving on the dial plate of the Borghesi clock,
for instance. In the center of the dial plate is engraved the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Questo orologio l'ideai e lo feci nella mia avanzata età
d'anni 80. Bart<sup>o</sup> Ant<sup>o</sup> Bertolla"</p>

<p>(I designed and made this clock at my advanced age of 80 years.
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla.)</p></blockquote>

"sit planetis" or "sit planetarum." The use of an abbreviation was
necessary to prevent the addition of another letter I or M, which would
have disturbed the formation of the chronogram desired. Literally, "sit
planetis" means "May he be eternal ruler <i>by</i> [or <i>through</i>] favor of
the planets," while "sit planetarum" is to be translated "May he be
eternal ruler <i>of</i> the planets." Father Winters considered both versions
somewhat overexaggerated and proposed that the best translation might be
"Long Live Francis I, Emperor."</p></div>

Hercules separated them to allow the river to pass between them. The
word "Tempe" is also used to mean any pleasant place. Thus, the

SYNOPSIS OF THE COMPLETE MECHANICAL WORKS OF THE FIRST CLOCK</h3>

<blockquote><p>[Translated from the section entitled "Synopsis Totius Operis
Mechanici" in Francesco Borghesi's first book <i>Novissima Ac
Perpetua Astronomica Ephemeris Authomatica
Theorico-Practica</i>....]</p></blockquote>


<h4 class="appx">I</h4>

<p>Of three movable indices, the farthest from the center of the dial is
fitted with an index on either side and marked with four segments of a
circle. Immediately below are five numbers, divided into the days of
setting the measure of the mean-synodic age of the moon, and into signs,
degrees of the signs, and of the distance of the moon from the sun.
These, in each revolution, revolve once around the solar disk
superimposed on the mean synodic-lunar disk, and also around the lunar
disk. The upper indices, meanwhile, in the two external greatest orbits,
measure the time continuously, in the accustomed manner of the
Germans&mdash;the middle index measuring by hours and the uppermost by the
first minutes [of hours].</p>


<h4 class="appx">II</h4>

<p>Inside these three circles, perpendicular above their center, is a small
index of the seconds of minutes. At each first minute of time, being the
fastest of all, it describes the smallest orbit. Next to this are two
other slightly larger circles divided into 30 degrees, one [rotating?]
from the right, the other from the left. These two indices are arranged
in such a fashion that the one rotating from the observer's left
completes its period 12 times during one, mean, solar-astronomical year.
The one [rotating] from the right likewise completes its cycle 12 times
during the period of one mean-synodic moon. In between these, there is
placed another small sphere, divided into 40 arbitrary parts, whose dial
does not move automatically, but is moved by hand for speeding up or
slowing down the course of the time, or of the perpendicular.</p>


<h4 class="appx">III</h4>

<p>Diagonally from the sides of the center of the three larger indices, six
other indices revolve: three on the left from one center, and three on
the right from another. The uppermost of the three which are on the
right of the observer [and which are] decorated with a small disk of the
sun, runs its cycle once during a mean solar-astronomical year. The
second measures the distance of the sun from its apogee. The third
revolves 12 times, with each lunar revolution from one node to the same
[repeated] node. Under the point of the uppermost index, first lie the
months of the year which are inscribed, and the days of each month, but
having only 28 days assigned to February; then the signs of the zodiac,
and their several degrees. The circle corresponding to the middle index,
extending through the first semicircle from apogee to the lower perigee
and returning through the second semicircle to the upper locations of
apogee, shows the true equation or eccentricity of the sun, joined with
the little equation of the moon in syzygy. [These equations are]
measured by geometric-astronomic propor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>tion for each distance of the
sun from its apogee or perigee in degrees, and in sufficiently small
parts of degrees, with the title added above in their proper places,
whether an addition is to be made to the mean location of the sun or a
subtraction from the same, so that the true longitude of the sun may be
calculated. Three circles are assigned to the lowest index, of which 30
degrees of distance of the moon from its nodes comprise the larger. The
middle circle is based on the hypothesis of the mean invariable
diameters (that is, of the sun, the moon, and the terrestrial shadow),
and is divided into hours and quarters of duration. The last circle is
divided by the trigonometric laws into the inches of magnitude of lunar
eclipses. Lying between these circles, there is another eccentric circle
(black with a spot) exhibiting the shadow of the earth, in which the
little moon sinks itself, carried by the lowest index. In any ecliptic
full moons, the patent number of inches of immersion somehow affects the
minds of the cultured, but also the scheme of maximum obscuration
affects the eyes of the illiterate themselves.</p>


<h4 class="appx">IV</h4>

<p>Of the three indices which revolve from the left, the uppermost
completes its cycle within 12 hours, just as the hour index. The middle
one with two pointers on diametrically opposite sides, carries the marks
of conjunction and opposition of the luminous bodies, with a movement
equal to the course of the sun from lunar apogee or perigee. The lowest
index, fitted with a single pointer, indicates the motion of the moon
from its apogee or perigee. Under these three indices, there is situated
a common circle, divided into 12 parts, each of which are further
divided into 30 parts through its outer circumference. I have said a
common circle, for, with respect to the first index, the division
represents 12 hours, and the double subdivision representing the double
set of minutes of the hours serves for an excitator for anytime at all,
at will. For as often as the little index reaches the twelfth hour,
first being moved by hand wherever you prefer, a little hammer strikes
the little bell many times. But if you observe the second or the third
index, the first division provides the signs, and the subdivision of the
signs gives the individual degrees of the distance of the sun from the
lunar apogee, or of the moon from its apogee, respectively. To this is
added two other interior circles from the same center: to the larger is
inserted the equation of the center of the moon in its conjunctions and
oppositions; and on the smaller the equation of the same moon in its
quarters, astronomically-geometrically proportioned to the distance of
the moon from its apogee or perigee. In the first case, the equation is
to be subtracted from the mean longitude of the moon, descending from
apogee to perigee; in the second case, to be added to the mean longitude
of the moon ascending from perigee to apogee; and, in the third
semicircle of the index, as the rubric directs, common to both
equations, added around the center.</p>


<h4 class="appx">V</h4>

<p>Perpendicularly under the center of the machine, two other indices are
carried about one and the same center. The one nearer to the
observer&mdash;bearing in one of two points diametrically opposite the small
disk of the sun, in the other the disk of the moon&mdash;runs a course equal
to the motion of the sun from the head or the tail of the dragon
(<i>Draco</i>). The other, of simple construction, marked with a small moon,
signifies in like manner the motion of the moon from the head or the
tail of the dragon.</p>

<p>Immediately below, there is a larger circle, common [referring] to both
these indices, which is divided into 12 parts. Each of these parts in
turn, in the outer periphery, is subdivided further into 30 parts, which
are the 12 signs of the zodiac and the individual degrees of the signs
of distance of the sun and the moon from the head of the dragon.</p>

<p>In the second circle is read the latitude of the moon, measured by
degrees, etc., on a trigonometric scale, by signs and degrees of
distance of the moon from its nodes, that is, from the head or tail of
the dragon. When the second index is descending from the head of the
dragon to the tail, the latitude will be to the north of the solar path;
that is, the ecliptic. On the other hand, it will be south of the
ecliptic when the same index is returning upward from the tail to the
head of the dragon as advised by the title inscribed on the third
circle.</p>

<p>Finally, on the fourth and last circle are seen more prime minutes of
the circle for reducing the orbit of the moon to the ecliptic. That the
true longitude of the moon may be obtained more accurately, these must
be subtracted from the longitude of the moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> already calculated in the
first and third quadrant of the circle of the second index. On the other
hand, they are to be added to the same in the second and fourth
quadrant, as is noted in their respective places, according to the
theory of right ascensions.</p>

<p>Here, then, [you have] as finally completed, delineation of the great
index which was partially described before in this book.</p>

<p>From two points of that index which perpendicularly correspond to the
center of these circles, a pair of compasses, by an unvaried aperture up
to the circumference of the first larger circle, has marked off four
segments of a circle. The two larger segments, equal among themselves,
in one aperture refer to the sun, and the two smaller in the other,
likewise equal, refer to the moon. The one pointer is for determining
the solar eclipses; the other, for lunar. Both segments of each
division, like little wings of the index, stretch to the extent of the
degree of distance of the moon from its nodes, and to which that
determined latitude corresponds. On one side, that latitude precisely
equals the radii of the earth, the sun, and the moon, as the termini of
solar eclipses; and, on the other side, precisely equals the radii of
the earth's shadow and of the moon, as the confines of lunar eclipses.
The apexes of the last index, diametrically limited [opposite], indicate
the age of the moon, and its mean distance from the sun; one pointer,
upon which the sun sits, measuring the mean days and degrees from the
full moon; the other, on which the moon sits, measuring the mean days
and degrees from the new moon.</p>


<h4 class="appx">VI</h4>

<p>Besides the larger and smaller indices already mentioned, all [of which]
revolve within the periphery of the three largest circles, six dials in
this clock also revolve within the same circles which are to be seen
through six openings of the frontispiece. The first of these, intended
to indicate the phases of the moon by an unusual method (completely
black, and decorated with the characters of the principal aspects of the
moon) continually revolves interiorly around the center of the machine
and at the new moon, it completely removes from sight the face of the
moon through the round window. It continually recedes through the first
half of the circle until, at the time of the full moon, it restores the
moon, looking out with a full star. Soon again, too slow to be
observed, it returns through the other half of the circle, so that in
the next conjunction, the whole face of the moon may have a covering of
darkness, once again to be removed.</p>

<p>The other dials are moved by spontaneous advances at stated times. The
first of these shows, through a square opening, the day of the month;
the second, through another opening, shows the current day of the week
with the characters of the seven planets which, according to ancient
superstition, preside over each day of the week (now, by a truer form of
religion divided by the Church into ferias, etc.); that is, the sun, the
moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, to which I have added
the numbers of the ferias. These two little dials are advanced daily, by
a sudden movement at midnight. The remaining three are changed
automatically only once a year on the first of January.</p>

<p>The first of these dials contains five little cells, opening from a
common window: in the first cell, at the edge of the dial, is found the
dominical letter; in the second, the cycle of the sun; in the third, the
character; in the fourth, the sign; and, in the fifth, the house of the
planet dominating the year. The second dial shows the epacts, with the
golden number. The third, and last of all, shows the Roman cycle.</p>

<p>Finally, as indicated by the epact and the dominical letter in an
immovable table added outside, are the feastdays and other movable
events of the year; that is, Easter, the four seasons, the Rogation
Days, etc.</p>


<h4 class="appx">VII</h4>

<p>But lest the various movements of the indices and the various beginnings
of the divisions tend to cause some fatigue, the precaution has been
taken, that all the indices by common law are moved from the top towards
the right of the observer, and from thence all the arithmetic divisions
of the circles take their beginning. And lest the multitude of different
figures should deceive the eye, the larger divisions of the circles have
been marked by Roman numbers, that is, by capital letters of the
alphabet; others, in other places, by differently colored numbers. Thus,
the movements of the indices, the distribution of the circles and the
multitude of numbers not only do not disturb the eyes and the mind, but
rather marvelously delight them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="appx">VIII</h4>

<p>After having completed briefly the description of the dial and the
indices and their motions, I have not without reason delayed in
satisfying the desires of many who wish to learn at least the method by
which, from this mechanism, may be calculated the true times of new and
full moons, and their ecliptics. In order to make these matters clearer,
it is necessary that they be explained here at greater length.</p>

<p>With the indices, then, adjusted astronomically-geographically to the
longitude of any given region, and to the mean time whether past,
present or future, and assuming the clock to be in normal operation (as
at present it has been for a whole year and more), then the moon will be
in conjunction with the sun in the heavens. When the equations on the
mechanism are examined, the sun and moon shall be found to be in the
same degree of longitude, and in the same part of a degree. There will
also be an ecliptic new moon that is in conjunction with a solar
eclipse, or rather with a terrestrial eclipse. This will occur if, at
that time, both apexes of the first index, located below the center of
the clock, are hidden by the two segments of the circle extending from
the center of the mechanism through the lowest index.</p>

<p>And the eclipse will be greater and greater and, consequently, visible
in more regions of the earth, the more deeply the two pointers,
indicating the distance of the sun from its apogee, are hidden in the
center of the segments.</p>

<p>But whether the eclipse takes place in the head or in the tail of the
dragon, or whether it is north or south, is indicated by the small disk
of the sun attached to one of the two pointers hidden by the segments of
the circle. If, at that time, the little disk shall be found in the head
of the dragon inscribed on the plane of the dial, then the sun has been
snatched from the earth and ingloriously entombed, as it were, in the
huge jaw of the dragon. Then, ... the heavens themselves will lend aid
to the woeful pomp of the senseless funeral in full darkness by suddenly
lighting the unhappy lamps of the fixed stars. However, if the little
disk occupies the tail of the dragon on the mechanism, then the sun in
the heavens also, as if freed from the toils of the immense dragon's
tail, will emerge without difficulty.</p>

<p>The center of the eclipse will traverse the hemisphere of the earth
north of the solar path, always nearer to the pole of the ecliptic, in
proportion to the inclination of the disk to the north. On the other
hand, if the little disk inclines to the left semicircle, then the
people south of the solar path will enjoy the spectacle of the total
central eclipse.</p>

<p>But if the little disk remains neutral (inclining neither way) and
remains halfway between the two sections of the circle, then the
greatest solar eclipse will take place at the equator and those who live
near the poles of the ecliptic will not enjoy a trace of that eclipse.
This is because the half of the equatorial diameter enormously
outmeasures even the greatest apparent semidiameters of the sun and of
the moon, even taking as a norm the smallest horizontal parallax of the
moon.</p>

<p>What has been said about the true new moon is to be understood also,
proportionately, about the true full moon. For when, with respect to the
equations of the centers, the moon shall be distant on the mechanism by
a full semicircle from the sun (also in the heavens it will be truly in
opposition to the sun) there will be a true full moon. Likewise, the
moon in the heavens will be in eclipse if, at the time of opposition,
the pointers of the little index (which we mentioned before) situated
below the center of the clock are so far away from the belly of the
dragon that they are forced to lie under the two smaller segments of the
circle which, in all full moons, are always to be moved from the index
of the synodic moon to the region of that little index. As a matter of
fact, the closer the little pointers approach to the middle of the
segments, the more obscured it will be.</p>

<p>You will know, furthermore, that the eclipse of the moon occurs in the
head of the dragon if the disk of the little moon, attached to the other
point of the little index, is raised to the head of the dragon;
conversely, when the little disk of the moon inclines to the tail, the
eclipse is taking place in the tail of the dragon.</p>

<p>And, accordingly, when you observe the little moon of the index inclined
to one or other section of the circle, so also in the heavens, the
eclipse of the moon is only partial and the northern or the southern
part of the moon is illuminated.</p>

<p>The current time will indicate whether the lunar eclipse is visible or
not. As the new moon ecliptic falls during the day, the eclipse will not
be visible, since the earth denies a sight of the moon which is below
the horizon. But, conversely, if there are no clouds, the eclipse will
be visible anywhere, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> luminous bodies are ecliptically in
opposition at night.</p>

<p>Since lunar eclipses appear to all people as being of the same magnitude
and duration, and begin and dissipate at the same absolute moment of
time, I decided to reveal another facet of this spectacle on the right
side of the center of the clock (see chapter III above). There, at the
time of the true ecliptic full moon, as the pointer of the third little
index shows, you can ascertain the hours, etc., of duration, and the
inches of greatest obscuration. The little moon attached to the index is
a model of the actual eclipsed moon.</p>


<h4 class="appx">IX</h4>

<p>Thus, with the aid of this machine, solar and lunar eclipses of the past
can be recalled and future ones can be foreseen. Indeed, if the index of
prime minutes is speeded up by hand, whose wheel imparts motion to the
other indices and shields, then, the dials and openings will foretell
the year, month, day, hour, etc., of any future eclipse. I foresaw that
the times would thus be evolved too slowly, and that the clock wheels
would be considerably worn by repeated experiments (if, for instance, by
the rotation of the index of prime minutes, to whose period only a
single hour corresponds, the future new and full moon ecliptics were
being investigated). Therefore, I took care that the wheel which
immediately communicates motion to the index of the synodic moon should
be so fitted internally to the mechanism that by the reversal of any
external index, the wheel would be removed from its proper position;
whenever desired, it could be quickly and most accurately restored to
its proper place.</p>

<p>In this way, since the close meshing of the wheels is released, you can
extend the experiment for many years, even for many centuries. You have
only to guide with your hand the index of the synodic moon on the
circles, always intently observing whether, in the passage which this
index makes over the little index, both pointers of the little index are
hidden by the segments of the circle. Having observed this, look at the
index moved by hand, for if this has carried the solar disk halfway
between the two larger segments of the circle to the region of the
hidden little index, then you will know that eclipse will be a solar
eclipse. On the other hand, you will know that it will be a lunar
eclipse, if the index (moved by hand) has carried the moon, situated
between the two smaller segments of the circle, to the same region
(i.e., the hidden part of the circle). The solar disk and the lunar disk
alternately will reveal to you the circumstances of both eclipses. The
current year will be given by the Julian period, reducible to any
desired epoch, and, contained in the solar cycle, the golden number and
the Roman cycle. The month of the year and also the day of the month
will be indicated by the pointer of the little index, first on the right
side of the clock. And what I have said of future eclipses should be
equally understood of past eclipses, so long as the index, which can be
moved either way at will, is moved in reverse.</p>

<p>Finally, though 55 wheels were employed to carry so many dials, all are
driven by one source of power not exceeding the third part of a Germanic
hundred-weight which, suspended at the geometric height of five feet
(about the ordinary stature of a man), keeps the whole machine in
operation for a hundred days and more.</p>

<p>Although the machine repeats hours and quarter hours at will and,
consequently, the number of wheels and the rest of the apparatus
necessary for these functions is thereby increased, it has not grown to
an unwieldy size, however much one might erroneously imagine it to be.
It does not exceed the bulk of ordinary clocks hanging from a wall;
indeed, it scarcely equals these.</p>

<p>The entire machine, ready for operation, does not weigh more than 156
ounces, although it is made of steel or brass throughout and further
weighted with two bells and a rather large brass dial-plate.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many more things to be said, especially about the
mechanical structure of the wheels, but fearing to tire my kind reader
unduly by exceeding the bounds of a summary, I am forced to put an end,
though unwillingly, to this sufficiently shortened explanation of the
work. I have hope of giving satisfaction to many more when I shall have
communicated to the learned world another and completely new automatic
work, grander than this present one. It is already theoretically
completed in all its calculations, but still to be worked out
mechanically from the very beginning, if but God, thrice Best and
Greatest, bless the undertaking and mercifully grant life and health&mdash;to
whom be in, and from, and through all things, all honor and glory in
eternity and beyond.</p>

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
